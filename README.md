# Graph-plotter

*This is still in development!*
I want it to plot more than one points in the graph. Also I will fix the described bug in the comments of the code.
Anyways, FILE DESCRIPTION:

main.cpp- The main c++ source file.


Graph-plotter.exe- The .exe executable file which can be directly executed from Windows systems.


Graph-plotter.cbp- The Code::Blocks project file.


I hope I will be able to update it with proper guidance. Tips are appriciated at dhiralvyas@gmail.com =)
